Before you choose to take part, it is important that you understand what this intervention is about and what you will be asked to do. If you have any questions or would like more information about the study, please contact our research coordinator (riseatwork@utoronto.ca). \n\nRecent studies have shown that reducing sitting time and increasing physical activity is related to a range of psychological and physical health benefits, which includes enhancing mood and concentration, and mitigating risk factors for cancer and chronic disease. We believe that RISE@Work will help you to make some small but important shifts to your daily routine. Over time, these shifts may leave you feeling healthier in and out of work!\n\nWhat will I be asked to do?\nThe first week of the intervention is the baseline phase where you will be asked to stick to your usual routine and keep track of how many steps you take each day using a pedometer. Over the following 10 weeks, you will learn specific evidence-based strategies to take breaks from sitting at your desk, and gradually increase the time that you spend walking before, during and after the work day. You will be asked to enter your total steps on the website at approximately the same time each day so you can keep track of your progress over the full 11 weeks. Participants will also receive exclusive access to download the Take a Stand desktop alert application that helps to break up the time spent sitting at work. A small group of 10-12 participants will be randomly selected and requested to wear an accelerometer during the baseline week and the final week (week 11). \n\nAll participants will complete two online questionnaires: the first at baseline after you first login to the RISE@Work website, and the second at the end of the 11-week program. The baseline questionnaire asks about different areas of your life, including your general health and wellbeing, physical activity participation, sitting time, work productivity, and some broad questions about you (e.g., age, education). You will be asked many of these same questions following the 11-week program, plus questions about your impressions of the RISE@Work website and program.\n\nIf you have any questions about your rights as a participant, please contact the Office of Research Ethics at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or 416-946-3273.\n\nI have carefully read the participant information that was emailed to me. I understand that: \n-RISE@Work is an 11-week web-based program to increase walking and reduce sitting time. \n-Throughout the program, I will be asked to wear a pedometer and record my step count on the RISE@Work website at approximately the same time each day. \n-I will be asked to fill out an online questionnaire at the beginning and end of the program. \n-Participation in this study is voluntary. \n-I can withdraw at any time without justifying my decision and with no prejudice or disadvantage to me. \n-All information that I provide will be kept private and confidential. \n-I will not be personally identified in any documents relating to RISE@Work, including reports and publications. \n-I have completed the PAR-Q and it is safe for me to start a walking program.', '2015-07-03 21:11:51', NULL, 'EUA', NULL, NULL, '2015-07-03 21:11:51')[0m

Shorter planned walks last for about 10 minutes and make you breathe a little harder and feel slightly warmer.</p>\n <p>You now have access to two new tools: Action Planning and Routes. Action Planning involves creating a detailed walking plan with the steps you will take so you can reach your new target step count. You could plan to walk some of the way to and from work, take a walk at lunch with a friend, or plan a walking meeting. The Routes tool provides ideas and links for short walks at your workplace.
